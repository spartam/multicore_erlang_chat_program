    % * Wall clock time measures the actual time spent on the benchmark.
    %   I/O, swapping, and other activities in the operating system kernel are
    %   included in the measurements. This can lead to larger variations.
    %   os:timestamp() is more precise (microseconds) than

    % * CPU time measures the actual time spent on this program, summed for all
